An online calculator meant to calculate the total loan amount and weighted 
interest rate of multiple student loans if they were to be consolidated into
one.

Made because my useless federal student loan provider doesn't have an option to
do this on their web portal and I find myself constantly running this in my own
Excel sheet whenever I make a loan payment. After speaking with many others 
with student loans, I found this is a common problem and felt this calculator 
ought to live online somewhere. My aspiration for this project is for this to be
a simple, clean, visually appealing calculator webpage that helps recent grads
(or anyone else with multiple forms of debt, really) find a quick answer to
their problem.
